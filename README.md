## ‚òÅÔ∏è Overview

This is the **alpha** version of **TIO**.

**Status:** We're working on the first MVP (1 node **localhost** cluster for **Linux¬Æ** & **MacOS¬Æ**).

## üí• Features

Some of the features of TIO are inspired from [k8s/complexities.md][repo-docs-vision-comparisons-k8s-complexities.md].

### Simplicity.

- **üç¶ CLI**: Minimal [cli](#-usage) (interface) (e.g. `tio + l.yml`).
- **ê¨∫ Config:** Minimal [Statefiles](#-usage) (`yml`).
  - Built-in `user` management with intuitive `cli` login
  - Built-in `container` `secrets` injection
  - WIP
- **üöÄ [Quickstart](#-quickstart):** Be ready in seconds.
  - [1 curl away](#-quickstart) cluster setup
    - TIO [ctl/cli][tinyoctl] (`tio`)
    - TIO `cluster` ([tinyonode][tinyonode], [tinyokv][tinyokv], [tinyort][tinyort])
    - ([Docker Hub][hub.docker.com] image (user-selected))
    - ([VSCode Server][vscode-server] (+ [devcontainers][devcontainers/templates]))

### Cluster

<blockquote>
 <span>
    In a nutshell TIO is just an orchestration of runtimes.
 </span>
</blockquote>

- **Efficiency**: **Lowest** possible resource **requirements**
  - RAM (+ Bandwidth)
  - IOPS
  - Disk
  - ‚û°Ô∏è Significantly **smaller** than [K8s][kubernetes.io] for similar tasks (**less** cloud/operation **costs**)
- **Scaling:** Infinite (Network **mesh**)
- **Speed:** Fast ([Rust][rust-lang.org] & **low-level** libs, achieving lowest **container startup** times, WIP)
- **Decentralized mesh**
  - **No master**/worker topology entities.
- **Upgrades:** Hustle free (**simple** system -> better **LTS compatibility**)
- **Recursive:** Cluster in cluster (tint) per default (**backup**/**restore** whole clusters with ease using [tinyoctl][tinyoctl])
- **Dynamicity:** E.g. [etcd.io][etcd.io] for [K8s][kubernetes.io] has [important limitations][repo-docs-vision-comparisons-k8s#etcd-limitations] we want to address with [tinyokv][tinyokv].

### Runtime

#### Optimized Intra-Node Containers

##### ‚ö°Ô∏è Direct Network

| Measurement                                    | TIO   | K8s  | Docker Desktop |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|------|----------------|
| Container to Container Network Throughput [mb]  | WIP   | WIP  | WIP            |

TIO introduces an innovative feature for optimizing container communication on the same node, **reducing overhead** and improving performance. Unlike traditional networking approaches that rely on full TCP/IP stacks or ingress mechanisms, this runtime leverages **direct communication** methods tailored for **Linux** architectures.
Standard mechanisms will be added in the future to keep more advanced features **optional**.

###### Key Features

- **Unix Domain Sockets (`UDS`):** Enables fast and efficient inter-container communication without the overhead of TCP/IP. Each container communicates via `UDS` managed by the runtime.
- **Shared Memory (`shm`):** Facilitates low-latency data exchange by sharing memory regions between containers for intensive data transfers.
- **Kernel Bypass with `eBPF`:** Utilizes `eBPF` for advanced packet routing and filtering, optimizing node-level communication pipelines.
- **Direct Process Piping:** Supports lightweight communication using `POSIX` pipes for simpler `IPC` requirements.

###### Benefits

- **Performance Boost:** Drastically reduces network latency and overhead compared to standard container networking.
- **Secure Isolation:** Maintains strict namespace isolation and access control to ensure container security.
- **Customizability:** Designed for flexible implementation to fit diverse container workloads.

##### ‚ûï Instant Duplication

| Measurement                                    | TIO   | K8s  | Docker Desktop |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|------|----------------|
| 1000 alpine:x.y.z Container Parallel Start [s]    | WIP   | WIP  | WIP            |

This feature introduces an approach to container instantiation based on existing ones in **milliseconds** on a single node. Instead of traditional container creation workflows, which rely on extracting and initializing container images from scratch, this method enables **low-level duplication of existing containers** already running on the node. This drastically reduces the time required to spin up identical containers, providing a significant performance boost for scenarios requiring rapid scaling or cloning.

###### Key Features

- **Low-Level Duplication:** Leverages Linux¬Æ kernel features to clone running containers directly, bypassing traditional workflows for image extraction and initialization, enabling seamless replication.
- **Blazing Fast Startup Times:** Launches new containers in milliseconds by reusing filesystem layers, memory, and resources from existing containers on the same node.
- **Dynamic Resource Optimization:** Detects and reuses running containers on the node, minimizing redundant resource allocation and improving performance.
- **Advanced Filesystem Snapshotting:** Uses cutting-edge Linux¬Æ technologies like `overlayfs` and copy-on-write (`CoW`) layers to efficiently duplicate container filesystems without full re-extraction.
- **Secure Namespace Cloning:** Maintains container isolation while replicating Linux¬Æ namespaces (`PID`, `IPC`, `UTS`, etc.), ensuring secure and consistent environments for each instance.
- **Memory Optimization with KSM:** Employs Kernel Same-page Merging (`KSM`) to share common memory pages between duplicated containers, reducing memory overhead without sacrificing performance.
- **Rust-Powered Efficiency:** Built with Rust for high-performance, low-level operations, ensuring safe and reliable container duplication with minimal system impact.

###### Benefits

- **Rapid Scaling:** Scale up workloads almost instantly by duplicating existing containers on-demand.
- **Significant Speedup:** Duplication is faster than traditional container creation methods, even those optimized by tools like Kubernetes.

Check out the [k8s/complexities.md][repo-docs-vision-comparisons-k8s-complexities.md] for an overview of the challenges we want to address, among others.
Please give the **community feedback** about your opinion regarding the development of TIO ([Issues][repo-issues]/[Commits][repo-commits]/[Discussions][repo-discussions]).

## üèÅ Quickstart

Just execute & you're ready to orchestrate on any platform (coming soon). This automatically **installs** `tinyoctl` & **initializes** a local **cluster** on the host system. **Be ready in seconds:**

```bash
sh curl tinyo.io/get | bash
```

Deploy a **[VSCode Server][vscode-server]** with a user-selected **[Docker Hub][hub.docker.com]** image in just one click and a magic password using [tinyocloud][tinyocloud] (WIP).

Running TIO **requires root** due to the use of **Linux¬Æ namespaces**, pivot_root, mounting filesystems, modifying network interfaces and so on.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the **security implications** before using TIO Alpha.

‚ö†Ô∏è The current alpha version of TIO should only be used in a controlled environment, such as a **virtual machine** (or container, but currently not supported) to prevent **unintended side effects** on your **host system**.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Usage

<blockquote>
 <span>
    We try to achieve more with less.
 </span>
</blockquote>

TIO uses **minimal Statefiles** (`yml`) which are managed via [tinyoctl][tinyoctl] cli.

First **setup** the first cluster **node** via `tinyoctl` cli (alias **tio**) by providing a network name, username & password of your initial admin user:
```sh
tio ++ -net [network_name] -u [admin_username] -p [admin_password]
```

To **add** more **nodes** just execute the command above on a different host system with the following `tinyoctl` flag in addition:
```sh
-ip [IP of any other existing node]
```

To **isolate containers** just **create** additional **clusters**. A container has **network access** to **any** other container in one cluster.

Here is an **example** to create 1 container with 1 port & 2 mounts:

```sh
tio + alpine-1.yml
```

```yaml
# Source: https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyoctl/blob/release/alpha/0.0.1/examples/basic/alpine-1.yml
container: "alpine:latest"
port: 8080
mounts:
  - source: "/etc/hosts"
    target: "/mnt/hosts"
  - source: "/tmp/local-config"
    target: "/config"
```

## Architecture

### Components

The system has the following **4 main components**. [tinyoctl][tinyoctl] interacts with [tinyonode][tinyonode] to start [tinyort][tinyort]. [tinyokv][tinyokv] is the data store for the TIO cluster [node(s)][tinyonode].
Don't worry about master/worker nodes and so on. The system operates similarly to a **mesh** topology:

- **[tinyoctl][tinyoctl]:** Contains cli and packages intended for use by client programs.
- **[tinyonode][tinyonode]:** Controller for each cluster node. Think of it as biolerplate code which is orchestrating the [runtime][tinyort](s).
- **[tinyokv][tinyokv]:** A high performance distributed Key-Value store for [tinyonode][tinyonode] (WIP).
- **[tinyort][tinyort]:** Runtime

E.g. the [tinyort/src/utils/core.rs][tinyort-src-utils-core.rs] currently has the size of about **350** code lines. The **MVP** should remain **below 2-3k** lines for single localhost container with storage & networking (+ Docker Hub download, ..).

To improve TIO and to make it completely accessible to the entire developer community, we introduced the following **3 additional components:**

- [tinyoapt][tinyoapt]: Advanced Package Tool to simplify the setup of various applications within a cluster.
- [tinyodash][tinyodash]: TIO Pro Dashboard for local development & cloud operations.
- [tinyort-fuzzer][tinyort-fuzzer]: Partial automated Fuzzer for the TIO [container runtime][tinyort].

### Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Solve localhost environment

- Minimal prototype
  - Start alpine container **faster** than **Docker** with low-level libraries
- Base version
  - WIP

### Vision

<blockquote>
 <span>
    Developers want simple, but highly effective tools that reduce (local) infrastructure complexity.
 </span>
</blockquote>

#### Comparisons

##### General

- RAM/Memory bandwith is expensive. If we're Rust + tiny this could reduce cloud costs in general.

##### Docker Desktop

- **Speed:** Be faster. (Container/TIO App startup, tinyoctl execution, WIP)
- **Accessibility:** Better GUI (lean, clean & fancy)
- WIP

##### Kubernetes

We **simplify** known K8s difficulties step by step.
To take a look at the most known challenges **jump to [k8s/complexities.md][repo-docs-vision-comparisons-k8s-complexities.md]**.

The goal is to **support important use cases** & **workflows** for which K8s is often used today.
