# ê¨∫ TinyO

<blockquote>
 <span>
    It's tiny, but it's fast.

</blockquote>

**TinyOrchestrator** - A minimal & easy to use Hybrid Cloud Orchestrator.
It is currently in an **early alpha** state.
We're working hard on the first safe **single node localhost version** for **Linux** & **MacOS**.
Feel free to [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join-7289DA.svg?logo=discord&longCache=true&style=flat)](https://discord.gg/ERKBk6ArnQ).

## Quickstart

Just execute & you're ready to orchestrate on any platform (coming soon):
```bash
sh curl tinyo.io/get | bash
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Use the current alpha version of TinyO only in a controlled environment, such as a **virtual machine** or container (currently not supported) to prevent **unintended side effects** on your **host system**.
Running TinyO **requires root** due to the use of Linux namespaces, pivot_root, mounting filesystems, modifying network interfaces and so on.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the **security implications** before using TinyO Alpha.

## Usage

TinyO uses **minimal Statefiles**.
Here is an example with 1 Container, 1 Port & 2 Mounts:

```yaml
# Example: 1 Container + 1 Port + 2 Mounts
container: "alpine:latest"
port: 8080
mounts:
  - source: "/etc/hosts"
    target: "/mnt/hosts"
  - source: "/tmp/local-config"
    target: "/config"
```

## Roadmap

##### Phase 1: Solve localhost environment

- Minimal prototype
  - Download & start alpine container **faster** than **Docker** with low-level libs,
configurable via a **minimal Statefile** (`yml`).
- Base version
  - WIP

## Vision

<blockquote>
 <span>
    Developers want simple, but highly effective tools that reduce infrastructure complexity.
 </span>
</blockquote>

## Comparisons

### Docker Desktop

- **Speed**: Be faster. (Container/TinyO App startup, tinyoctl execution, WIP)
- **Accessibility**: Better GUI (lean, clean & fancy)
- WIP

### Kubernetes

We aim to **simplify** known K8s difficulties step by step.
The goal is to **support important use cases** & **workflows** for which K8s is often used today.

- **Config**: Minimal Statefiles (start with one config line if wanted)
- **Local development**: Start your local containers easily (Quick Quickstart)
- **Cluster topology**: Just a dynamic mesh. E.g. no master & worker network entities.
- **Upgrades**: Hustle free (simple specs -> better LTS compatibility)
- **Scaling**: Infinite (Network mesh entities)
- **Recursive**: Cluster in cluster per default (backup/restore whole clusters easily within a cluster)
- **Speed**: Fast (Rust & low-level libs, achieving lowest container startup times)
- **Efficiency**: More RAM/IO efficient than K8s for similar tasks (less cloud costs)
- **Security**: More stable runtime security
- **Dynamicity**: etcd limitations
- **Monitoring**: Best possible dashboard visualizations (Inspiration: github.com/k8svisual/vpk)
- WIP

## PureLinux DAO

<blockquote>
 <span>
   We think that every contributor should have their fair stake within the projects. Most important for us is that barrier to contribution is as low as possible.
 </span>
</blockquote>

The project development is still very new, please feel free to join our [Discord][discord] for **open discussions**.
We try to **scale the development with the community** so that the project achieves optimal momentum.
Because the **codebase** is in general relatively **small**, one doesn't have to dive too deep into prebuilt structures to make valuable contributions.
We try to give **best possible credit to every contributor** who's bringing this project to the world.

<blockquote>
 <span>
   It's not good for a project when someone digs themselves into a rabbit hole alone, because it makes it harder for others to join or contribute later.
 </span>
</blockquote>

At PureLinux, we try hard to build a decentralized autonomous organization to redefine how open-source **contributions** are **rewarded** and **governed**. We find this very important for the project to grow perfectly.

<blockquote>
 <span>
   It's not just about how big your seat is; it's more about how high the plane is flying.
 </span>
</blockquote>

Our mission is to create a **community-driven Linux ecosystem** that ensures fairness, transparency, and accessibility for all contributors.
**Key features** of the organization will include:

- **Reward Mechanisms**: Valid contributions are rewarded through a transparent token system, ensuring every contributor receives a fair stake based on their personal efforts.
- **Quadratic Funding**: A funding mechanism that prioritizes community-backed initiatives, amplifying the impact of collective support.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Token holders actively participate in shaping the project's direction through votes, empowering contributors to drive innovation.
- **Low Contribution Barriers**: We aim to make contributions seamless and rewarding, both on GitHub and beyond.
