**TinyOrchestrator** - A minimal Hybrid Cloud Orchestrator.
It's currently in an early **alpha** state.
We're working on the first safe **single node localhost version** for Linux & MacOS.

Please give the **community feedback** about your opinion regarding the development ([Issues](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo/issues)/[Commits](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo/commits)/[Discussions](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo/discussions)).

**MVP** should remain **below 1k** lines for single localhost container with storage & networking (+ Docker Hub download, ..).

## Quickstart

Just execute & you're ready to orchestrate on any platform (coming soon):
```bash
sh curl tinyo.io/get | bash
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The current alpha version of TinyO should only be used in a controlled environment, such as a **virtual machine** (or container, but currently not supported) to prevent **unintended side effects** on your **host system**.

Running TinyO **requires root** due to the use of **Linux namespaces**, pivot_root, mounting filesystems, modifying network interfaces and so on.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the **security implications** before using TinyO Alpha.

## Usage

TinyO uses **minimal Statefiles** combined with a simple [tinyo-ctl](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo-ctl). 
Here is an example to create 1 container with 1 port & 2 mounts:

```sh
tinyo + examples/basic/alpine-1.yml
```

```yaml
# alpine-1.yml
container: "alpine:latest"
port: 8080
mounts:
  - source: "/etc/hosts"
    target: "/mnt/hosts"
  - source: "/tmp/local-config"
    target: "/config"
```

## Architecture

The system has the following 3 main components. [tinyo-ctl](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo-ctl) interacts with [tinyo-node](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo-node) to start [tinyo-runtime-container](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo-runtime-container).
Don't worry about master/worker nodes and so on. The system operates similarly to a **mesh** topology:

- [tinyo-ctl](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo-ctl): Contains cli and packages intended for use by client programs.
- [tinyo-node](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo-node): Controller which is running on every cluster node.
- [tinyo-runtime-container](https://github.com/pure-linux/tinyo-runtime-container): Container runtime

The [features/runtime/core.rs][src-features-runtime-core.rs] currently has the size of about **350** code lines. Take a look at the [Runtime Core Architecture][docs-runtime-core-readme.md].

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Solve localhost environment

- Minimal prototype
  - Download & start alpine container **faster** than **Docker** with low-level libs,
configurable via a **minimal Statefile** (`yml`).
- Base version
  - WIP

## Vision

<blockquote>
 <span>
    Developers want simple, but highly effective tools that reduce (local) infrastructure complexity.
 </span>
</blockquote>

### Comparisons

#### Docker Desktop

- **Speed**: Be faster. (Container/TinyO App startup, tinyoctl execution, WIP)
- **Accessibility**: Better GUI (lean, clean & fancy)
- WIP

#### Kubernetes

We aim to **simplify** known K8s difficulties step by step.

The goal is to **support important use cases** & **workflows** for which K8s is often used today.

- **Config**: Minimal Statefiles (start with one config line if wanted)
- **Local development**: Start your local containers easily (Quick Quickstart)
- **Cluster topology**: Just a dynamic mesh. E.g. no master & worker network entities.
- **Upgrades**: Hustle free (simple specs -> better LTS compatibility)
- **Scaling**: Infinite (Network mesh entities)
- **Recursive**: Cluster in cluster per default (backup/restore whole clusters easily within a cluster)
- **Speed**: Fast (Rust & low-level libs, achieving lowest container startup times)
- **Efficiency**: More RAM/IO efficient than K8s for similar tasks (less cloud costs)
- **Security**: More stable runtime security
- **Dynamicity**: etcd limitations
- **Monitoring**: Best possible dashboard visualizations (Inspiration: github.com/k8svisual/vpk)
- WIP

## PureLinux DAO

All IP (Code, ..) of PureLinux is owned by the DAO and the DAO is owned by the contributors of the DAO.

<blockquote>
 <span>
   We think that every contributor should have their fair stake within the projects. Most important for us is that barrier to contribution is as low as possible.
 </span>
</blockquote>

The project development is still very new, please feel free to join our [Discord][discord] for **open discussions**.
We try to **scale the development with the community** so that the project achieves optimal momentum.
Because the **codebase** is in general relatively **small**, one doesn't have to dive too deep into prebuilt structures to make valuable contributions.
We try to give **best possible credit to every contributor** who's bringing this project to the world.

<blockquote>
 <span>
   It's not good for a project when someone digs themselves into a rabbit hole alone, because it makes it harder for others to join or contribute later.
 </span>
</blockquote>

At PureLinux, we try hard to build a decentralized autonomous organization to redefine how open-source **contributions** are **rewarded** and **governed**. We find this very important for the project to grow perfectly.

<blockquote>
 <span>
   It's not just about how big your seat is; it's more about how high the plane is flying.
 </span>
</blockquote>

Our mission is to create a **community-driven Linux ecosystem** that ensures fairness, transparency, and accessibility for all contributors.
**Key features** of the organization will include:

- **Reward Mechanisms**: Valid contributions are rewarded through a transparent token system, ensuring every contributor receives a fair stake based on their personal efforts.
- **Quadratic Funding**: A funding mechanism that prioritizes community-backed initiatives, amplifying the impact of collective support.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Token holders actively participate in shaping the project's direction through votes, empowering contributors to drive innovation.
- **Low Contribution Barriers**: We aim to make contributions seamless and rewarding, both on GitHub and beyond.
